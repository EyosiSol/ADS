# Accident Detection System with Ultrasonic Sensing and GPS

This project combines ultrasonic distance sensing, accident detection, and emergency response features using GPS and GSM modules. The system is designed to detect accidents through simulated ultrasonic sensors, send real-time location data via GPS, and initiate an emergency response through GSM calls and messages.

## Features

- **Ultrasonic Sensing Simulation**: Simulates two ultrasonic sensors to detect distances and trigger actions based on proximity.
- **Emergency Response**: Calls an emergency number and sends the GPS coordinates in case of an accident.
- **GPS and GSM Integration**: Utilizes GPS to track and share real-time location data and GSM to handle the emergency communication.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following libraries and software installed:

### Libraries:

1. **GPS Library**: Required for interfacing with the GPS module.
2. **GSM Library**: Required for communicating with the GSM module for emergency calls.
3. **Arduino Uno Library**: Required for programming the Arduino Uno.

Both the libraries and their `.hex` files will be provided in the **Libraries** folder of this repository.

### Software:

1. **Arduino IDE**: To upload the code to the Arduino board.
2. **Proteus**: To simulate the hardware components and visualize the system's behavior.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

1. **Download Libraries**:

   - Navigate to the **Libraries** folder in this repository.
   - Copy the **GPS Library and Hex**, **GSM Library and Hex**, and **Arduino Library and Hex** files.

2. **Install the Libraries**:
   - Open the **Program Files** directory on your PC (usually under `C:\Program Files (x86)`).
   - Navigate to `Labcenter Electronics > Proteus 8 Professional > DATA > LIBRARY`.
   - Paste the copied library files into this folder.
   - These libraries are now accessible in the **Proteus** simulation software.

### Step 2: Setup Proteus Simulation

1. **Install Proteus**:

   - Download and install **Proteus** (if you haven’t already) from the official website.

2. **Configure Components**:
   - Open **Proteus** and add the components you need for this simulation (e.g., GPS module, GSM module, Arduino Uno).
   - For each component (GPS, GSM, Arduino), follow these steps to associate them with the appropriate `.hex` files.

### Step 3: Configure GPS, GSM, and Arduino in Proteus

1. **Configure the GSM Module**:

   - Double-click on the **GSM module** in your Proteus workspace.
   - In the **Edit Properties** window, click on the **Program File** option and select the **GSMLibraryTEP.hex** file from the **Libraries** folder.

2. **Configure the GPS Module**:

   - Double-click on the **GPS module** in your Proteus workspace.
   - In the **Edit Properties** window, click on the **Program File** option and select the **GPSTEP.hex** file from the **Libraries** folder.

3. **Configure the Arduino Uno**:
   - Double-click on the **Arduino Uno** in your Proteus workspace.
   - In the **Edit Properties** window, click on the **Program File** option and select the **[Accident_Detection_System].hex** file from the **Arduino Code** folder.

### Step 4: Upload Code to Arduino

1. Open the **[Accident_Detection_System].ino** file in the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.

### Step 5: Start Simulation in Proteus

Once you've completed the above steps, you can start the simulation in **Proteus** and observe the behavior of the accident detection system. When the ultrasonic sensors detect a certain distance, the system will trigger the emergency response, which includes sending location data via GPS and calling the emergency contact through GSM.
